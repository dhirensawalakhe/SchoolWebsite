Add your site logo here.

Filename: logo.png (accepted formats: .png, .jpg, .svg)

Place the file at: src/assets/logo.png

The app will attempt to load this file at runtime and use it in the site header/logo. If you prefer a different filename, update `src/app/components/Logo.tsx` dynamic import accordingly.
